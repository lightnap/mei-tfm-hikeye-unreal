# Hikeye Unreal

This is my Master's Thesis project for the Master in Informathics Engineering offered by the UPC school.

This is a prototype that was never finished, as we switched our framework from Unreal to QT.

[This](https://github.com/lightnap/mei-tfm-hikeye-qt) links to the finalized project in the QT framework. 

In the following image we can see how far into the project we got before changing frameworks. We were able to load a terrain from height map data but we had trouble loading a texture over said terrain.
